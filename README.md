# CCipher
A simply shift cipher in Python

After reading The Code Book by Simon Singh, I took an interest in ciphers. While I wasn't ready to develop the next RSA,
I thought it would be interesting to try to make a cipher program.

This simple python program allowed me to exercise many of the programming techniques I'd learned while learning the language.

Operation:

Enter PLAINTEXT
Enter SHIFT
Output CIPHERTEXT
